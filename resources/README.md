## Learn more R?

If you are interested in learning more about R in general, check out
[swirl](https://swirlstats.com). swirl teaches you R programming and data
science interactively, at your own pace, and right in the R console! You
can do this directly in the Duke OIT RStudio Docker Containers.

The below books are also great resources. R Cookbook is for beginners, while
R for Data Science does require some basic knowledge of R.

- R Cookbook - https://rc2e.com
- R for Data Science - https://r4ds.had.co.nz/

## Recommended Readings! 

For this first class, I would recommend reading R Cookbook 1.6 - 1.12 as well as
2.1 - 2.6. From R for Data Science, read 2-5, and 10-12.
